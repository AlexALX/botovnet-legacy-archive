# Botov-Net Cs 1.6 Server Archive (2015)

This directory contains the CS 1.6 game servers setup, plugins, and tools
historically used for the Botov-NET project (botov.net.ua), which operated
until 2015.

It is published as a **historical archive and a reference for developers**
who want to study or reuse server configurations, plugins, and scripts
for their own projects.

> ⚠️ Note: All plugins were written for CS 1.6 amxmodx 1.8.1, hlds <6027.
> Without modifications, they are unlikely to work on modern CS 1.6 versions.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is a fan-made, archival project.
> The author has no affiliation with Facepunch Studios (Rust) or Valve (CS).
