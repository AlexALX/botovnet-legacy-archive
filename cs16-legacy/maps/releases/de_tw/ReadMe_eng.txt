Description      : Map for the battle, have their own secrets :)
Instalation      : Upload the all files from folder map-files(_full) in a folder with the game.
------Notes-----------------------------
This map is completely symmetrical (with the exception of a few buttons).
Map enclosed in 2 copies:
1. The folder contains a map-files circumcised version of the map, it removed:
* 90% less lighting (lamps).
* A few break walls (instead of them just a door). 
* Small objects (this is invisible lesnitsy that helped to climb into some holes). 
* Only 28 players.
It should be put on a server with different modes (AMXX, zombies, and others). 
2. Folder map_files_full contains the full version of map, but if map dont work (error: ... item count is over the 512 limit), then you should be circumcised version (if it does not help, then you have too many installed mods for cs).
