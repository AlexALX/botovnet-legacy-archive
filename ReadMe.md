# Repository Overview

## Project History

This repository archives materials from the **Botov-NET project** (botov.net.ua), which existed from **2008 to 2015**.

Botov-NET featured **unique CS 1.6 servers**, including popular **Zombie server** (modified biohazard mod), and later went to **Rust servers**. 
After 2015, the project was closed, but its plugins, maps, and other assets have been preserved here for **archival and educational purposes**.

> ⚠️ Note: This repository contains archival materials from the Botov-NET project.  
> It is intended for **educational, reference, and preservation purposes**.

Some files include configuration placeholders such as API keys and require adjustment before real use.
